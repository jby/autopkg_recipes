# jby-recipes

My recipes for AutoPkg. If you use them, click the ![Star](README-images/star.png) button above to show your support!

Many of these recipes were created with the aid of [Recipe Robot](https://github.com/homebysix/recipe-robot), an app you should definitely check out.


## Installation

To add my repo to your Mac (with AutoPkg and Git already installed), run this command:

```
autopkg repo-add jby-recipes
```


## Dependencies

None - so far...

## Known issues

If you're having a problem with one of my recipes, [check the issues](https://github.com/autopkg/jby-recipes/issues) to see whether a known problem exists. If not, please [submit an issue](https://github.com/autopkg/homebysix-recipes/issues/new) so I can investigate.


## Submissions

Forks/pulls/issues are welcome. I'm always tweaking.
